    Notebooks
        Content Based Recommendation
        Popularity Based Recommendation
	Fuctions: This note book contains functions called in the other two notebooks.

    Introduction
        I used Python to build POPULARITY-based and CONTENT/ITEM-based movie recommender systems using popularity model 
        based on the average voting as well as vote count and cosine similarity respectively. 
        In the Jupyter notebook I've created functions to run the recommendations.
        The popularity was created to address possible cases in which no prior movie was seen or is to be supplied by the user; 
        while the content-based recommendation takes input of a movie and then return similar movies.

    Data
        The data had records for 4803 records agrregated for each movie.

    Improving the recommender:
        1. The codes can be improved by bringing the two methods used together such that a single function will generate
        the recommended movies based on the provided input
        2. The provision of user data is also expected to improve the recommendation with the possibility of running user-item 
        based recommendation .
